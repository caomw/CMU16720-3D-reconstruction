Homework 5 for CMU 16720 Computer Vision course.The theme of this project is 3D Reconstruction. The pipeline will first estimate fundamental matrix as well as essential matrix. Then Given the calibrated intrinsics, it will compute a 3D metric reconstruction from 2D correspondences using triangulation. Finally, the project will automatically match points taking advantage of epipolar constraints and make a 3D visualization.
